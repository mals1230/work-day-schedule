# work-day-schedule

I created this schedule to assist employees with busy schedules. 

This page opens to the current date and has hourly time-blocks to assist with scheduling. These time blocks can be edited in real time and a color-coding feature allows the user to see past, present and future events. 

This webpage users Bootstrap, jquery, moment JS and Google Fonts to make the page seamless for it's users.
